<p>React, developed by Facebook, is an open source library for building User Interfaces. As the front end world moves
    too fast you should not be hesitant to try out new things. I am a big fan of AngularJS and a few months back I
    started trying React. As React doesn't assume anything about rest of your tech stack it plays well with others. The
    biggest reason for me to try React was to create isomorphic apps that render on both client and server (with a
    little help from other libraries as well). In this article I am going to share 10 best reasons to use React in your
    next project.</p>
